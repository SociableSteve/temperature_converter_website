# temperature_converter_website

Code that works on the project at https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/temperature-converter-website-atx32dy7mf

Run with `npx serve` from the root directory, or otherwise just open the file in your browser.

Uses vanilla JS. The `handler.js` file handles changes to the form, and setting values based on those changes. `converter.js` contains code to convert to/from celcius for different scales.
